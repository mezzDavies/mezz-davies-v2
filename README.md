This is the HTML and CSS for my portfolio site. Having completed the Northcoders Coding Bootcamp I wanted to gain some more experience with some simple HTML and CSS as I had still to "just" make a website. I designed the site with Figma to both get some experience with that and to work out how it might work responsively. I then built the site "mobile first" trying to be as semantic with the HTML as I could. It is a simple site but I learned much doing it and it does the job required for the time being.
