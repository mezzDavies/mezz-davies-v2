            NC News is a front end web application (made as part of my time on
            the Northcoders Bootcamp). It is similar in style to reddit where
            users are able to view articles and vote on them (up or down) as
            well as view, post and delete related comments. The hosted version
            can be found by clicking on the above image. The app fetches and
            writes its data via an API that I also made - please see below for
            details.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although there is no authentication implemented, you are "logged in"
            as a user and as such some functionality of the website works
            accordingly e.g you are only able to delete comments associated with
            that user. Please have a click around the website and add a comment
            to an article, vote on an article etc. The web app is built with
            React and was my first time styling with CSS and has kick-started my
            keen interest in front end development.

            This project is the API for the above web app. It is a RESTful
            server made with Express.js that ustilises a Postgres (aka
            PostgreSQL) database. It was created using TDD with Jest and full
            list of the available end points is available (in .JSON format) by
            clicking on the above image.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although satisfying and kind of magical getting it all up and
            running, honestly, making this API was challenging - I had to make a
            mind-map-flowchart-thing to help me get my head around all the
            moving parts involved! You can view the outpourings of my brain

            The final project from my time on the bootcamp was a group project
            and we created a meal planning app with React Native. As well as
            being responsible for the core app idea I was primarily involved in
            the development of the front end of the app. I was also exposed to
            Firebase though - something I plan to learn more about soon. The
            above 5 minute video (3 mins 20 secs if watched on x1.5 speed!)
            explains the app and our process in more detail and was used as our
            presentation video on graduation day.

          Thanks for looking at my portfolio site. I am a graduate of the
          <a
            class="project__link"
            href="https://northcoders.com/our-courses/coding-bootcamp#curriculum"

          >
            Northcoders Full Stack Coding Bootcamp</a
          >
          and before enrolling on the bootcamp I had spent the main chunk of my
          working life involved in photography and video production in one way
          or another. Over time though I realised I wanted a change. I have
          always been interested in technology and creativity so web development
          seemed an ideal new career direction. As I researched what was
          involved I learned of the phrase "full stack" and so enrolled on a
          course that covered this to get a full understanding of what coding
          can entail.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so it is I have learned about so much more than front end web
          development. The course taught me fundamental javascript and coding
          concepts including data structures, asynchronous tasks, functional
          programming and OOP along with a good mix of Node packages. I also
          practiced Git version control, pair programming, test-driven
          development, Agile working, along with best coding practises. By the
          end of the course I had gone from very little coding experience to
          building and hosting a test-driven developed RESTful API with a
          complimentary front-end web app as well as a phone app. It was quite
          an intense but amazing journey!
        </p>
        <p>
          I really, really enjoyed getting a full stack education but I still
          feel my main interests and strengths are in front end development -
          problem solving combined with visuals and creativity is a great mix
          for me. I am not dismissing being involved with back end development
          though - not at all - because as I see it there is always a grey area
          between the front and back ends, so having experience and
          understanding of both will always be of interest and benefit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Away from computers I enjoy exploring the outdoors (usually either
          walking or cycling), cooking and spending time with my wife, friends
          and family. I like watching football and am a Leeds United season
          ticket holder. I also enjoy experimenting with electronic music
          production (oh that's not away from the computer). Scuba diving and
          snorkelling are strong but infrequently indulged passions too.

          Please do get in touch if you think we could work together. Cheers.
